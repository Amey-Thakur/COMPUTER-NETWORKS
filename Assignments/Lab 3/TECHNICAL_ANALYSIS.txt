# Lab 03: Analyzing 802.11 Wireless Structures
# --------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:
This analysis explores the IEEE 802.11 Link-Layer protocol, commonly known as Wi-Fi. We focus on management frames, specifically Beacons, and the complex addressing schemes required for wireless station association and multi-hop delivery in a Basic Service Set (BSS).

----------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: BEACON FRAME ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION 1: What are the SSIDs and BSSIDs of the access points that are radiating most of the beacon frames?
- SSIDs: "30 Munroe St", "linksys12".
- BSSIDs: 00:16:b6:f7:1d:51 (30 Munroe).
[EXPLANATION]: SSIDs are the human-readable names, while BSSIDs are the physical MAC addresses of the Access Points (APs) acting as the base stations.

QUESTION 2: What is the interval of time between the transmissions of beacon frames for '30 Munroe'?
- Interval: 0.1024 seconds (102.4 milliseconds).
[EXPLANATION]: This is the standard Beacon Interval defined in the 802.11 specification, allowing clients to periodically synchronize with the AP.

QUESTION 3: What are the data rates that the '30 Munroe' access point can support?
- Basic Rates: 1, 2, 5.5, 11 Mbps.
- Extended Rates: 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54 Mbps.
[EXPLANATION]: These fields advertise the capabilities of the AP to potential clients during the association process.

----------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: ADDRESSING & ASSOCIATION
----------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION 7: Identify the addresses used in the first 802.11 frame.
- Address 1 (Receiver): 00:16:b6:f7:1d:51 (The AP).
- Address 2 (Transmitter): 00:13:02:d1:b6:4f (The Station).
- Address 3 (BSSID): 00:16:b6:f7:1d:51.
[EXPLANATION]: The triple-addressing scheme ensures that frames are correctly routed through the wireless medium to the specific AP managing the BSS.

QUESTION 8: Is the MAC address of the final destination server contained in the wireless frame? 
- Answer: No.
[EXPLANATION]: Similar to Ethernet, the wireless frame only contains local hop addresses. The IP address (Layer 3) is used to reach the final destination across segments.

==============================================================
TECHNICAL CONCLUSION:
Lab 03 reveals the inherent complexity of wireless links compared to wired Ethernet. The reliance on period Beaconing and triple-MAC addressing provides the necessary coordination for stations to maintain connectivity in a shared, mobile, and often noisy electromagnetic medium.
