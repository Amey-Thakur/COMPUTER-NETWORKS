# Lab 04: Analyzing Dynamic IP Allocation (DORA)
# --------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:
This analysis explores the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which automates the assignment of IP addresses and network configuration to hosts. We focus on the four-step handshake known as DORA (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledgment).

----------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: THE DORA HANDSHAKE
----------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION 1: Identify the transport layer protocol used by DHCP.
- Protocol: UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
[EXPLANATION]: DHCP uses UDP ports 67 (Server) and 68 (Client) because it requires a lightweight, connectionless protocol that supports broadcasting before the client has an IP address.

QUESTION 2: What is the transaction ID in the DHCP messages?
- Transaction ID (XID): 0x74292ax (Example derived from trace).
[EXPLANATION]: This ID is generated by the client and remains constant across all stage of a single DORA handshake to ensure correct matching of messages.

QUESTION 3: At what Stage (1-4) does the client receive its IP address?
- Stage: Stage 4 (Acknowledgment).
[EXPLANATION]: While the Offer (Stage 2) proposes an IP, the allocation is only finalized when the server sends the ACK (Stage 4).

PART 2: PROTOCOL METADATA
----------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION 5: What is the IP address of the DHCP server?
- Server IP: 192.168.2.1 (The local gateway).
[EXPLANATION]: This is the authoratative device managing the address pool for the local subnet.

QUESTION 6: What is the IP address offered to the client?
- Offered IP: 192.168.2.95.
[EXPLANATION]: This is the temporary logical identifier assigned to the client for the duration of the lease.

QUESTION 7: What is the lease time offered in the DHCP ACK?
- Lease Time: 259200 seconds (3 days).
[EXPLANATION]: This indicates how long the client can reliably use the IP address before needing to renew the allocation.

==============================================================
TECHNICAL CONCLUSION:
Lab 04 demonstrates the elegance of DHCP in managing limited IP resources. The use of the Transaction ID and the DORA sequence enables robust, automated network setup, making modern plug-and-play networking possible.
