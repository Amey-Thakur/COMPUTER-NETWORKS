# Lab 09: Analyzing TCP Connection Management & Congestion Control
# --------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:
This technical analysis explores the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol. We examine the three-way handshake, sequence number synchronization, flow control (window sizing), and the dynamic phases of congestion control (Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance).

----------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT (THREE-WAY HANDSHAKE)
----------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION 1: What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source) that is transferring the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?
- Client IP Address: 192.168.2.95
- Client Port Number: 50533
[EXPLANATION]: This ephemeral port was assigned by the OS to the HTTP session.

QUESTION 2: What is the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? On what port number is it sending and receiving TCP segments for this connection?
- Server IP Address: 128.119.245.12
- Server Port Number: 80 (HTTP)
[EXPLANATION]: Port 80 is the well-known port for unencrypted web traffic.

QUESTION 3: What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu?
- Initial Sequence Number (ISN): 954047503
[EXPLANATION]: The ISN is randomly generated to protect against blind injection attacks and sequence number overlap.

QUESTION 4: Look at the Flags section. Is the SYN flag set to 1? Can the TCP receiver in this session use Selective Acknowledgments (SACK)?
- SYN Flag: Set to 1.
- SACK Status: Supported/Permitted.
[EXPLANATION]: SACK allows a receiver to inform the sender about all segments that have been received successfully, enabling more efficient retransmission of missing fragments.

QUESTION 5: What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer? What is the value of the Acknowledgement field?
- SYNACK Sequence Number: 1958276926
- Acknowledgement Number: 954047504
[EXPLANATION]: The server acknowledges the SYN (Ack = Client ISN + 1) and provides its own ISN.

----------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: DATA TRANSFER & FLOW CONTROL
----------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION 6: What is the sequence number of the TCP segment containing the header of the HTTP POST command?
- Sequence Number: 954047504
[EXPLANATION]: This follows the successful 3-way handshake (the ISN + 1).

QUESTION 8: What is the length of the first data-carrying packet? What is the length of the subsequent packets?
- First Packet Length: 684 Bytes (including headers).
- Subsequent Packet Lengths: 1492 Bytes (Maximum Segment Size compliance).
[EXPLANATION]: Bulk data transfer leverages the path's Maximum Segment Size (MSS) to minimize header overhead (40 bytes of header for 1452 bytes of data).

QUESTION 9: What is the minimum amount of available buffer space advertised at the receiver for the first four data-carrying segments?
- Minimum Window Size: 29200 Bytes.
[EXPLANATION]: The "Window" field indicates how many bytes the receiver is willing to accept without further acknowledgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3: CONGESTION CONTROL PHASES
----------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION 13: Identify the start and end of the Slow Start phase and the transition to Congestion Avoidance.
- Slow Start Phase: Starts at approx. 2.6 seconds; ends at approx. 2.8 seconds.
- Congestion Avoidance Phase: Transitions at approx. 3.2 seconds.
[EXPLANATION]: Slow start exponentially increases the congestion window (CWND) until a threshold or packet loss is met, at which point the protocol enters a linear growth phase (Congestion Avoidance).

==============================================================
TECHNICAL CONCLUSION:
Lab 09 demonstrates the robustness of TCP. By managing state via the three-way handshake and dynamically adjusting transmission rates through congestion control algorithms, TCP provides the reliability required for protocols like HTTP while ensuring network-wide stability.
