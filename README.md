                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->

## Overview
Computer Networks (ELEC 8560) is a critical core course in the Master of Engineering (MEng) program at the University of Windsor. This course provides a deep dive into the fundamental principles of data communication, network layering, and the suite of protocols that power the modern internet, with a strong emphasis on practical analysis and implementation.

### Course Objectives
The curriculum encompasses several key networking domains:
- **Network Layering**: Mastering matrix operations, numeric arrays, and function development for complex engineering tasks.
- **Protocol Analysis**: Utilizing Wireshark to dissect and analyze real-world network traffic across various protocols (HTTP, TCP, UDP, IP, Ethernet).
- **Addressing & Subnetting**: Mastering IPv4/IPv6 addressing schemes and the mathematical foundations of VLSM and CIDR.
- **Transport Mechanisms**: Analyzing the reliability, congestion control, and flow control mechanisms of TCP and UDP.
- **Network Infrastructure**: Exploring the design and operation of LANs, WANs, and wireless networking standards (Wi-Fi).

### Repository Purpose
This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, course assessments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As networking technologies evolve, the fundamental principles remain the bedrock of communications engineering. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for reviewing methodologies, refreshing theoretical concepts, and strengthening technical understanding.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental networking principles
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Computer Networks
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them

> [!NOTE]
> All materials were curated, compiled, and organized by me during the Fall 2023 semester as part of my MEng degree requirements.
